    Softmax loss function, naive implementation (with loops over N samples)

    In this function, you are NOT supposed to use functions like:
    - np.dot

    - np.linalg.norm
    You can (not necessarily) use functions like:
    - np.sum
    - np.log

    Inputs have dimension D, there are K classes, and we operate on minibatches
    of N examples.

    Inputs:
    - W: a numpy array of shape (D + 1, K) containing weights.
    - X: a numpy array of shape (N, D + 1) containing a minibatch of data.
    - y: a numpy array of shape (N,) containing training labels; y[i] = k means 
        that X[i] has label k, where 0 <= k < K.
    - reg: regularization strength. For regularization, we use L2 norm.

    Returns a tuple of:
    - loss: the mean value of loss functions over N examples in minibatch.
